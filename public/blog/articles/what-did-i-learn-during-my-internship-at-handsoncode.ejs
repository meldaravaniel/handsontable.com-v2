            <p>
                First year of university has ended, and its time to return to my hometown, Gdynia in Poland.
                This summer I aim to intern at the local "Silicon Valley". I wish to intern in a global company
                from my hometown, which is a tough task, since most of the companies here operate locally. Fortunately,
                I found <a href="http://handsoncode.net" target="_blank">Handsoncode</a> – a company that
                is <a href="/blog/articles/why-you-will-never-give-up-spreadsheets">revolutionizing spreadsheets</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward to now and after almost two months my internship is coming to an end, I will be leaving
                with a vast knowledge of the "Spreadsheet Market". I found out that people are constantly finding
                new ways to improve the way we crunch numbers, as the traditional spreadsheet is not the most
                user – friendly solution. Yet so many users still have to deal with the number of unnecessary
                functions and the tedious way tables work. Here at Handsoncode you have to build the table yourself,
                which is very helpful. It's like building a house – we will supply you the tools and workforce,
                but its ultimately your choice on how you want your house to look like. This is very interesting as
                even though there are so many people using the same product the end result is completely
                different.
            </p>

            </blockquote>
            <h3>Handsoncode as a company</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing that opened my eyes was the global scale of Handsoncode, we serve clients
                from all around the world. Secondly, I learnt about the importance of making fast decisions.
                Nobody dwells here for hours trying to decide which option to choose. The better option is
                quickly evaluated and brought into life, and if it turns out to be a bad choice – it can be
                always changed. It's all about making fast decisions, but not being afraid to change them even
                faster. We know that a new product will encounter many roadblocks in its journey, but the aim
                is to overcome it, no matter how difficult it may be.
            </p>
            <h3>What makes a product great?</h3>
            <blockquote>
                Spreadsheets are the backbone of many companies, especially in the financial industry.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                During my internship I realized that the most important thing that mattered to a customer was
                to be able to use a powerful product with ease. Advanced functionality combined with ease of
                use, is the recipe for success, but by no means an easy one. Having very complex functionality
                means spending a lot of the time on developing the product, however that usually deteriorates
                the user experience, which is why a company should try to seek a balance. Try to create the most
                functional product that is easy and pleasant to use. That's why it also takes time to release a
                new feature, it is important to make sure it is stable. As usually new features create new problems,
                hence a good new solution should maximize functionality but minimize the risk.
            </p>
            <h3>My chance to participate</h3>
            <p>
                Even though I was an intern, I participated in a lot of discussions. Being able to contribute
                with my ideas was possible thanks to the support from my team. While discussing nobody cares if
                you are the head or a new employee, all inputs are encouraged. And additionally every idea is given
                equal attention, there isn't an answer as "We won't do it, because no" every decision is justified
                so that we can learn and improve. It is vital to guide employees so that they are able to grasp the
                way a company operates. Which is why experienced a lot of support when doing my projects. Never once
                during my internship did my senior hand me something new without first sitting down with me and
                explaining what I needed to do. And while doing my task I had many "checkups" on how my work is
                going on, if I need any assistance or help. These small gestures made me feel more comfortable and
                eventually produce better results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to everybody at Handsoncode who have made this internship possible!
                I have learnt a lot thanks to you.
