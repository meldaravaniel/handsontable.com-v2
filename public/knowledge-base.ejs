                            <p>Handsontable Community Edition (CE) is a free software released under the MIT license.
                                Handsontable Pro comes with a commercial license and contains additional features such as filters.
                                It has free maintenance and support plan included for limited time, depending on the type of the license.
                                <a href="/features.html">Here</a> you can find a comparison of features available for each Handsontable version.
