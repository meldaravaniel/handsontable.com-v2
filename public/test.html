    <h4>How do you define a developer?</h4>
    <p class="news hide"> A developer is every person in your organization working directly with Handsontable source code.
        That includes implementing, integrating or changing the code.</p>
</div>
    <div class="story">
    <h4>How many licenses do I need?</h4>
    <p class="news hide"> You need one license for every developer working directly with Handsontable. Licenses are not assigned to a particular
        person but to each seat. If the overall number of developers changes overtime, you have to
        acquire new licenses for them.</p>
</div>
    <h4>Can I still use Handsontable after 12 months from the purchase?</h4>
    <p class="news hide"> Yes, you can. Once you buy a license you can use it without time boundaries. Although after 12
        months from the purchase date you lose the possibility to get updates and support. In order to
        keep them you should obtain Extended Support and Maintenance. Be quick though, if you do it before
        the time ends you get a 50% discount.</p>

    <div class="story">
    <h4>What is the difference between Developer and OEM license?</h4>
    <p class="news hide"> Developer License is intended for a single developer and allows to use Handsontable for creating
        websites, web apps, intranets and SaaS projects. It does not include the installation of the
        software on customers' premises nor selling in an OEM model. Contact our
        <a href="mailto:sales@handsontable.com">Sales Team</a> in order to get a quote on OEM version.</p>
</div>

    <div class="story">
    <h4>How does on-premises software work?</h4>
    <p class="news hide"> You can either install the software remotely or by doing it on site.
        You can do it through your employee or directly by your customer. </p>
</div>

    <div class="story">
    <h4>May I use Handsontable while working on many domains / servers / projects?</h4>
    <p class="news hide"> Yes, Developer License allows you to use the code on unlimited amount of domains, servers or projects.
        What is more, it does not depend on whether it is a test or production environment.</p>
</div>

    <div class="story">
    <h4>Am I allowed to add more developers to my license?</h4>
    <p class="news hide"> Yes, there is such a possibility. Contact us to do so.</p>
</div>

    <div class="story">
    <h4>Let's say we need more than 10 licenses. Is there a discount for us?</h4>
    <p class="news hide"> By default, whenever you get 5-9 licenses we offer you a 10% discount. For 10 there is a 15% discount.
        In case you want more than that please contact our
